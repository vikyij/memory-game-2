## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind css
- React Testing Library


### What I learned

My knowledge on typescript was drastically increased, learnt more about testing with react testing library and jest. I managed state with useReducer hooks and I learnt how to use tailwind css. I generally improved in my problem solving ability and the ability to break down problems into smaller bits.


### Continued development

I'll like to write more tests for the application
